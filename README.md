# LLM Project

## Project Task
I chose the Topic Modelling task, which involves taking text from the 20_newsgroups dataset and sorting it into groups based on the text's content. 

## Dataset
The 20_newsgroups dataset comes presplit into training and testing sets, both prelabeled with true categories, both as a numerical value and a string. These string values reveal that the categories are the end result of breaking down larger, less specific categories into more granular ones. There are 11.3k items in the training set, and 7.5k in the test set, with a nearly uniform distribution across the 20 categories present.
